# Derivative-Pricing
Some derivative pricing models in Matlab.  
This file contains some derivative pricing functions, including pricing American/European option/straddle with discrete dividends using binomial tree method and Asian option using Monte Carlo simulations. For the Binomial Tree pricing models, we return option prices as well as the replicating portfolio for every node and the early exercise date for American options.
