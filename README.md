# Derivative-Pricing
Some derivative pricing models in Matlab. 
This file contains some derivative pricing functions, including American/European option/straddle with discrete dividends in Binomial Tree models and Asian Option using Monte Carlo simulations. For the Binomial Tree pricing models, we return option prices as well as the replicating portfolio for every node and the exercise date for American options.
